We always welcome contributions! Feel free to update our pages. Don't worry too much about whether it's good enough: we'll finish the details if necessary.

In case you're interested, we have some style guidelines at /source/Pages/documentation/style_guidelines.rst. But don't worry too much about that. We'll take care of that.

If you don't know how to submit your contribution, you can just email it to helpdesk@surfsara.nl (please mention "Grid documentation") and we'll take care of it.
