# Origin of the sphinxcontrib.youtube extension

There is an extension for sphinx called sphinxcontrib.youtube on PyPI, but that is an old version of this one. Or maybe it is a completely different code base, which just happens to have the same goal. I am not sure.

This code is copied/based on the extension with the same name, found here: https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx-contrib It's license can be found in the file LICENSE in the same directory as this file is in.

However, I have made some changes based on a pull request for the extension that is available on PyPI. It is this pull request: https://github.com/shomah4a/sphinxcontrib.youtube/pull/7 I believe this code to be published under the GNU Lesser General License v3 (LGPLv3)

I am no legal expert, but believe these two licenses to be compatible. And I think I am complying to both licenses. If not, please let me know!
