To deploy your production runs smoothly on the Grid, our services can be of great value. Our standard services are indispensable for using the Grid, while additional services are available as an option. For additional services a separate offer can be made.

* Standard Grid Services like User Interfaces, Brokers, and Virtual Organisation management services
* ``Token Pool`` Services (:ref:`topos-overview` and :ref:`picas-overview`) for production run logistics, job collection management, monitoring and control
* Virtual filesystem service :ref:`softdrive` for centralized software deployment on distributed systems
* Dedicated ``light-paths``: we offer support bridging the last mile between the end points and your data sources.
* ``Consultancy``: advice and support on getting access, working with grid certificates, basic job submission, data access methods, best practices, advice on design and optimization of applications for performance improvements, integration with large-scale job-submission frameworks, and international upscaling.
