About
=====

The Grid consists of a large number of various clusters which are distributed all over the Netherlands and even abroad. SURFsara offers Grid services in cooperation with ``Nikhef`` and ``RUG-CIT``. All together form the **Dutch National Grid Initiative** (NGI_NL) offered to scientists affiliated with Dutch universities and institutes. 

The Grid can be used for a variety of purposes, however a single grid can be dedicated for a specific purpose. As for example our `Dutch Grid`_ infrastructure, which consists of a small number of tightly interconnected clusters, operated in a collaboration between SUFRsara, NIKHEF and RUG-CIT, is very potent in enabling ``high-throughput`` processing of ``large datasets`` in a minimum amount of time.

=====================
National and European
=====================

The Dutch portion of the Grid is connected to `EGI`_, the European Grid Initiative. This allows Grid users in the Netherlands and abroad easy access to one another's resources. EGI also supplies central monitoring and ensures the homogeneity of participating clusters.
