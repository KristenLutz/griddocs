Large data processing  
*********************

In this page we will show an example for running applications on multiple LSG clusters that also require big volumes data:

.. contents:: 
    :depth: 4

.. sidebar:: lcg/lfc/lfn? Only for large files with multiple replicas.

	The lectures ``Data Management on the Grid`` :ref:`partI <mooc-lcg-lfn1>`, :ref:`partII <mooc-lcg-lfn2>` and :ref:`partIII <mooc-lcg-lfn3>` present the lcg/lfc/lfn :ref:`storage-clients`. However, we advise you to better use the :ref:`globus` or :ref:`srm`, unless you need to run jobs on multiple sites which require access on the **same** large dataset (or database). In case of doubts, contact us at helpdesk@surfsara.nl.
