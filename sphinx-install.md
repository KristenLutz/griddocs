# Sphinx-install

## Introduction

The grid documentation itself is written in *restructured text*. The HTML documentation is generated using *Sphinx*. 
This page explains how to install the software, how to generate HTML documentation from the source, and how to edit and structure the documentation.


## Installing Sphinx

### Linux

On recent linux distributions, *sphinx* is included in ```epel```. Fedora has it included in the standard distribution. Install *sphinx* with

```sh
    sudo yum install -y python-sphinx
```

On Ubuntu, install with

```sh
    sudo apt-get install python-sphinx
```

### Mac OSX

On Mac OSX, you will need [macports](https://www.macports.org), so get that if you have not done so.

Next, follow the instructions on the [sphinx installation page](http://sphinx-doc.org/install.html).

**Important:** the standard terminal in Mac OSX has locale settings incompatible with sphinx; to change it once for a terminal session, type:

```sh
    export -n LC_CTYPE
```

To change it permanently:

1. open the terminal preferences
2. go to the tab 'advanced'
3. uncheck "Set locale environment variables on startup"
